 * This file contains compression data destination routines for the case of
 * emitting JPEG data to memory or to a file (or any stdio stream).
 * While these routines are sufficient for most applications,
 * some will want to use a different destination manager.
 * IMPORTANT: we assume that fwrite() will correctly transcribe an array of
 * JOCTETs into 8-bit-wide elements on external storage.  If char is wider
 * than 8 bits on your machine, you may need to do some tweaking.
