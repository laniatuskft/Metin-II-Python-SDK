 * This file contains the JPEG system-independent memory management
 * routines.  This code is usable across a wide variety of machines; most
 * of the system dependencies have been isolated in a separate file.
 * The major functions provided here are:
 *   * pool-based allocation and freeing of memory;
 *   * policy decisions about how to divide available memory among the
 *     virtual arrays;
 *   * control logic for swapping virtual arrays between main memory and
 *     backing storage.
 * The separate system-dependent file provides the actual backing-storage
 * access code, and it contains the policy decision about how much total
 * main memory to use.
 * This file is system-dependent in the sense that some of its functions
 * are unnecessary in some systems.  For example, if there is enough virtual
 * memory so that backing storage will never be used, much of the virtual
 * array control logic could be removed.  (Of course, if you have that much
 * memory then you shouldn't care about a little bit of unused code...)

/*
 * Some important notes:
 *   The allocation routines provided here must never return NULL.
 *   They should exit to error_exit if unsuccessful.
 *
 *   It's not a good idea to try to merge the sarray and barray routines,
 *   even though they are textually almost the same, because samples are
 *   usually stored as bytes while coefficients are shorts or ints.  Thus,
 *   in machines where byte pointers have a different representation from
 *   word pointers, the resulting machine code could not be the same.
 */


/*
 * Many machines require storage alignment: longs must start on 4-byte
 * boundaries, doubles on 8-byte boundaries, etc.  On such machines, malloc()
 * always returns pointers that are multiples of the worst-case alignment
 * requirement, and we had better do so too.
 * There isn't any really portable way to determine the worst-case alignment
 * requirement.  This module assumes that the alignment requirement is
 * multiples of sizeof(ALIGN_TYPE).
 * By default, we define ALIGN_TYPE as double.  This is necessary on some
 * workstations (where doubles really do need 8-byte alignment) and will work
 * fine on nearly everything.  If your machine has lesser alignment needs,
 * you can save a few bytes by making ALIGN_TYPE smaller.
 * The only place I know of where this will NOT work is certain Macintosh
 * 680x0 compilers that define double as a 10-byte IEEE extended float.
 * Doing 10-byte alignment is counterproductive because longwords won't be
 * aligned well.  Put "#define ALIGN_TYPE long" in jconfig.h if you have
 * such a compiler.

/*
 * We allocate objects from "pools", where each pool is gotten with a single
 * request to jpeg_get_small() or jpeg_get_large().  There is no per-object
 * overhead within a pool, except for alignment padding.  Each pool has a
 * header with a link to the next pool of the same class.
 * Small and large pool headers are identical except that the latter's
 * link pointer must be FAR on 80x86 machines.
 * Notice that the "real" header fields are union'ed with a dummy ALIGN_TYPE
 * field.  This forces the compiler to make SIZEOF(small_pool_hdr) a multiple
 * of the alignment requirement of ALIGN_TYPE.
