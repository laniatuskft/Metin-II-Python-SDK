 * This file contains initialization logic for the JPEG compressor.
 * This routine is in charge of selecting the modules to be executed and
 * making an initialization call to each one.
 *
 * Logically, this code belongs in jcmaster.c.  It's split out because
 * linking this routine implies linking the entire compression library.
 * For a transcoding-only application, we want to be able to use jcmaster.c
 * without linking in the whole library.
