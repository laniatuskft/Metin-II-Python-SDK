 * This file contains application interface code for the decompression half
 * of the JPEG library.  These are the "minimum" API routines that may be
 * needed in either the normal full-decompression case or the
 * transcoding-only case.
 *
 * Most of the routines intended to be called directly by an application
 * are in this file or in jdapistd.c.  But also see jcomapi.c for routines
 * shared by compression and decompression, and jdtrans.c for the transcoding
 * case.
